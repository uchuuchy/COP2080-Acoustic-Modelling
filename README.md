# COP2080-Acoustic-Modelling

The purpose of this program is to model the acoustics in a room. It calculates the following values to allow the user to assess and optimize the acoustics in a room:

 1. Low Frequency RT20 value
 2. Mid-Frequency RT20 value
 3. High Frequency RT20 Value
 4. Average RT60 value
 
 The RT60 value is the amount of time it takes for the sound energy to decrease by 60 dB after the source of the sound stops.
 
## How to Use
 1. Clone the repository
 2. Install the dependencies using requirements.txt
 3. Launch the program from gui.py
 4. Click the load button and chose your audio file **(1)**
 5. Use the next and previous buttons to go through the graphs generated

**(1)** This program only functions with **mono wave** files.
